A simple, fast, and secure command-line tool to check password strength and detect if a password has been exposed in a data breach.

## üìñ Description

This project provides a script to analyze password security directly from your terminal. It helps users make informed decisions about their credentials by providing two key pieces of information:

1.  **Password Strength:** Analyzes the password based on common complexity criteria (length, character types).
2.  **Data Breach Check:** Securely checks the password against the 'Have I Been Pwned' database using the **k-Anonymity** model. This ensures the user's password is never sent to any external server.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Instant Feedback:** Get immediate analysis of password strength and leak status.
- **Secure by Design:** Uses the k-Anonymity model to protect user privacy during the breach check.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Runs directly in your terminal with no GUI overhead.
- **Informative Reports:** Clear and concise output for both strong and weak passwords.
